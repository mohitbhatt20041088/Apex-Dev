# Top 50 Interview Questions: LWC Case Manager Component

## **Component Overview**
This document contains comprehensive interview questions for the Lightning Web Component (LWC) Case Manager that displays open cases, allows escalation/closure actions, and integrates with Apex backend methods.

---

## **1. Basic LWC Concepts (Questions 1-10)**

### Q1: What is Lightning Web Component (LWC) and how does it differ from Aura Components?
**Answer:** LWC is Salesforce's modern UI framework built on web standards like custom elements, templates, decorators, modules, and shadow DOM. Key differences:
- Better performance due to native browser APIs
- Smaller bundle size
- Uses standard JavaScript ES6+ features
- Two-way data binding is explicit
- Better security with Lightning Locker Service

### Q2: Explain the three files that make up an LWC bundle in this case manager component.
**Answer:** 
- **myCaseManagerComponent.js**: Contains the component's JavaScript logic, imports, wire services, and event handlers
- **myCaseManagerComponent.html**: Template file defining the UI structure using Lightning base components
- **myCaseManagerComponent.js-meta.xml**: Configuration file defining API version, exposure settings, and target contexts

### Q3: What does the `@wire` decorator do in this component?
**Answer:** The `@wire` decorator connects the component to Salesforce data. In this case:
```javascript
@wire(getMyOpenCases)
wiredCases(result)
```
It automatically calls the `getMyOpenCases` Apex method and provides reactive data binding. When data changes, the component automatically re-renders.

### Q4: How does this component handle loading states?
**Answer:** Uses an `isLoading` boolean property that:
- Starts as `true` initially
- Shows `lightning-spinner` when `true`
- Set to `false` after wire service completes
- Set to `true` during `submitAction()` and back to `false` in `finally` block

### Q5: Explain the purpose of the `refreshApex()` function in this component.
**Answer:** `refreshApex()` refreshes the cached result of a wire service call. After updating a case, it refreshes `this.wiredCaseResult` to get updated data from the server and re-render the component with fresh case information.

### Q6: What is the significance of the `key-field="Id"` attribute in lightning-datatable?
**Answer:** It uniquely identifies each row in the datatable using the record's Id field. This helps Lightning optimize rendering performance and maintain row state during updates.

### Q7: How does the component prevent XSS attacks?
**Answer:** Lightning Locker Service automatically sanitizes data. Additionally, the component uses proper data binding (`{modalHeaderText}`, `{comment}`) instead of innerHTML, which prevents script injection.

### Q8: What is the role of `LightningElement` in this component?
**Answer:** `LightningElement` is the base class that all LWC components extend from. It provides:
- Component lifecycle methods
- Event dispatching capabilities
- Template rendering
- Property reactivity system

### Q9: Explain the import statements used in this component.
**Answer:**
- `@salesforce/apex/CaseManagmentHandler.getMyOpenCases`: Imports Apex method
- `lightning/platformShowToastEvent`: For showing toast notifications
- `@salesforce/apex`: For refreshApex functionality
- `lwc`: Core LWC framework imports

### Q10: What makes this component reactive to data changes?
**Answer:** The `@wire` decorator creates reactive data binding. When the Apex method result changes, the `wiredCases` function automatically executes, updating the component's properties and triggering re-render.

---

## **2. Data Handling & Wire Service (Questions 11-20)**

### Q11: How does the component handle both success and error states from the wire service?
**Answer:**
```javascript
if(result.data){
    this.cases = result.data;
    this.error = undefined;
}else if(result.error){
    this.error = result.error;
    this.cases = undefined;
}
```
It checks `result.data` for success and `result.error` for failures, setting appropriate properties.

### Q12: What is the purpose of storing `this.wiredCaseResult = result` in the wire function?
**Answer:** It stores the wire result for later use with `refreshApex()`. This cached reference allows the component to refresh the data after performing updates without re-wiring.

### Q13: How does the `noCasesFound` getter work?
**Answer:**
```javascript
get noCasesFound(){
    return !this.isLoading && (!this.cases || this.cases.length === 0);
}
```
It returns `true` only when not loading AND either cases is null/undefined OR cases array is empty.

### Q14: What happens if the Apex method `getMyOpenCases` throws an exception?
**Answer:** The wire service will catch the exception and populate `result.error` instead of `result.data`. The component will set `this.error` and display the error state while clearing `this.cases`.

### Q15: Why is the wire service called `wiredCases` instead of just using the imported method name?
**Answer:** The wire service function name (`wiredCases`) can be different from the imported method (`getMyOpenCases`). This allows for clearer naming conventions and multiple wire services for the same Apex method if needed.

### Q16: How would you modify this component to accept parameters for filtering cases?
**Answer:** Add reactive properties and pass them to the wire service:
```javascript
@api recordId;
@wire(getMyOpenCases, {recordId: '$recordId'})
wiredCases(result) { ... }
```

### Q17: What security considerations apply to the wire service call?
**Answer:** 
- Apex method must be `@AuraEnabled`
- User must have appropriate object and field-level security
- Lightning Locker Service protects against XSS
- SOQL injection protection in Apex

### Q18: How does the component handle partial data loads or large datasets?
**Answer:** Currently, it loads all data at once. For large datasets, you'd implement:
- Pagination using `lightning-datatable` pagination attributes
- Lazy loading with infinite scroll
- Server-side filtering/sorting

### Q19: What happens if the `cases` property is modified directly in JavaScript?
**Answer:** Since it's not marked with `@track`, direct mutations won't trigger re-renders. However, assignment (`this.cases = newValue`) will trigger reactivity and re-render the component.

### Q20: How would you implement real-time updates for this case list?
**Answer:** 
- Use Platform Events with `empApi` to subscribe to case changes
- Implement streaming API connections
- Use `refreshApex()` on a timer interval
- Implement server-sent events

---

## **3. Event Handling & User Interactions (Questions 21-30)**

### Q21: Explain how the row actions in the datatable work.
**Answer:** 
- `action` array defines available actions with `label` and `name`
- Column type `"action"` with `typeAttributes: {rowActions: action}`
- `onrowaction={handleRowAction}` handles clicks
- `event.detail.action.name` identifies which action was clicked

### Q22: How does the component distinguish between different button clicks in the modal?
**Answer:** Each button has specific `onclick` handlers:
- Cancel: `onclick={closeModal}`
- Submit: `onclick={submitAction}`
The component doesn't need to distinguish as each has dedicated handlers.

### Q23: What is the purpose of `event.detail.row` in the row action handler?
**Answer:** `event.detail.row` contains the complete data object for the row where the action was clicked, providing access to all case fields like `Id`, `CaseNumber`, etc.

### Q24: How does the component handle the case number button clicks?
**Answer:**
```javascript
if(actionName === "view_case") {
    window.open(`/lightning/r/Case/${row.Id}/view`, '_blank');
}
```
It opens the case record page in a new tab using Salesforce's standard navigation pattern.

### Q25: Explain the modal state management in this component.
**Answer:** Modal state is controlled by:
- `isModalOpen`: Boolean flag controlling modal visibility
- `modalHeaderText`: Dynamic header based on action
- `actionType`: Stores current action ("Escalate" or "Close")
- `caseIdToUpdate`: Stores the case ID being processed

### Q26: How does the textarea value binding work for comments?
**Answer:**
```javascript
value={comment}
onchange={handleCommentChange}
```
Two-way binding: value displays current comment, onchange updates the property when user types.

### Q27: What would happen if `handleCommentChange` wasn't implemented?
**Answer:** The textarea would display the initial value but wouldn't update the `comment` property when users type, making the comment functionality non-functional.

### Q28: How does the component prevent accidental case updates?
**Answer:** 
- Uses modal confirmation before any action
- Cancel button allows users to abort
- Clear separation between view and edit modes
- Comment field allows users to document reasons

### Q29: What accessibility features are implemented in this component?
**Answer:**
- Modal has `role="dialog"` and `tabindex="-1"`
- Proper ARIA labeling through Lightning base components
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader support through semantic HTML

### Q30: How would you add validation before submitting actions?
**Answer:**
```javascript
submitAction(){
    if(this.actionType === 'Escalate' && !this.comment.trim()) {
        this.showToast('Error', 'Comment required for escalation', 'error');
        return;
    }
    // Continue with submission
}
```

## **4. Apex Integration (Questions 31-40)**

### Q31: How does the component communicate with Apex methods?
**Answer:** 
- Wire service for `getMyOpenCases` (reactive/cached)
- Imperative call for `updateCaseAction` (on-demand)
- Uses `@salesforce/apex` import namespace
- Parameters passed as objects

### Q32: What is the difference between `@wire` and imperative Apex calls in this component?
**Answer:**
- **@wire**: Automatic, cached, reactive data loading for read operations
- **Imperative**: Manual, on-demand calls for write operations with explicit error handling

### Q33: How does the component handle Apex method failures?
**Answer:**
```javascript
.catch(error=>{
    console.error('Error updating case:', error);
    this.showToast('Error', error.body?.message || error.message || 'An error occurred','error');
})
```
Uses optional chaining to safely access error properties and shows user-friendly toast messages.

### Q34: What parameters does `updateCaseAction` receive from this component?
**Answer:**
- `caseId`: String - ID of case to update
- `actionType`: String - "Escalate" or "Close"
- `comment`: String - User's comment

### Q35: How would you add loading states during Apex calls?
**Answer:** The component already implements this:
```javascript
this.isLoading = true;
updateCaseAction({...})
.finally(() => {
    this.isLoading = false;
});
```

### Q36: What security measures should the Apex methods implement?
**Answer:**
- `@AuraEnabled` annotation for LWC access
- `with sharing` for user context security
- Input validation and sanitization
- FLS (Field Level Security) checks
- CRUD permissions validation

### Q37: How does the component ensure data consistency after updates?
**Answer:** Uses `refreshApex(this.wiredCaseResult)` after successful updates to fetch fresh data from the server and maintain UI consistency.

### Q38: What happens if multiple users update the same case simultaneously?
**Answer:** 
- Salesforce handles optimistic locking at database level
- Last update wins for most fields
- Component refreshes data after each action
- Users see most recent state after their action

### Q39: How would you implement batch operations for multiple cases?
**Answer:**
- Add row selection to datatable
- Create batch action buttons
- Pass array of case IDs to Apex
- Handle partial success/failure scenarios

### Q40: What testing strategies apply to Apex integration?
**Answer:**
- Mock Apex responses in LWC Jest tests
- Unit test Apex methods separately
- Integration testing with test data
- Error scenario testing (network failures, exceptions)

## **5. UI/UX and Lightning Design System (Questions 41-50)**

### Q41: How does this component follow Lightning Design System (SLDS) principles?
**Answer:**
- Uses Lightning base components (`lightning-card`, `lightning-datatable`)
- SLDS utility classes (`slds-m-around_medium`, `slds-p-around_medium`)
- Consistent modal structure with `slds-modal` classes
- Proper spacing and layout patterns

### Q42: Explain the modal implementation using SLDS classes.
**Answer:**
```html
<section role="dialog" class="slds-modal slds-fade-in-open">
    <div class="slds-modal__container">
        <header class="slds-modal__header">
        <div class="slds-modal__content">
        <footer class="slds-modal__footer">
    </div>
</section>
<div class="slds-backdrop slds-backdrop_open"></div>
```
Standard SLDS modal pattern with proper semantic structure.

### Q43: How does the component handle responsive design?
**Answer:** Uses Lightning base components that are responsive by default, SLDS utility classes for spacing, and datatable automatically adapts to screen sizes.

### Q44: What Toast notification patterns are implemented?
**Answer:**
```javascript
showToast(title,message,variant){
    const event = new ShowToastEvent({
        title: title,
        message: message,
        variant: variant // 'success', 'error', 'warning', 'info'
    })
    this.dispatchEvent(event);
}
```
