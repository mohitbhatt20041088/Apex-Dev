# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the broken `onClickHandler` functionality in the testComponent Lightning Web Component and improves the parent-child component interaction pattern. The component currently has a non-functional click handler that should trigger actions in a child component and display appropriate toast notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parent component's click handler to properly communicate with child components, so that I can trigger actions across component boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the onClickHandler is triggered THEN the system SHALL successfully call the child component's method
2. WHEN the child component method is called THEN the system SHALL handle any errors gracefully
3. WHEN the interaction succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success toast notification
4. IF the child component is not found THEN the system SHALL display an error toast notification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and reliable toast notification functionality, so that users receive appropriate feedback for all actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any toast is triggered THEN the system SHALL display the toast with correct title, message, and variant
2. WHEN toast parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL use default values
3. WHEN multiple toasts are triggered rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for component interactions, so that the application remains stable when child components are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a child component method is called THEN the system SHALL verify the component exists before calling
2. IF a child component method doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL log an appropriate error
3. WHEN component interaction fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful feedback to the user
